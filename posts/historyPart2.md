title: I'm Complicated
---

I was almost a civil engineer. I worked very hard to attend GA Tech and was very successful through my junior year when I decided to transfer to a music program and wound up getting my Master's in Music. When I make a decision to change paths, I follow through. Regrets? It's complicated. My biggest regret is neglecting my knowledge base in mathematics. The most important lesson I take from it in retrospect? Changing paths doesn't have to mean giving up.
