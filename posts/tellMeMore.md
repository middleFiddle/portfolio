title: Tell Me More

Outside of web development, I teach people how to play music, most often on the violin, and I play viola with the Atlanta Opera. I try to read as much as I can, on programming, economics, philosophy and mathematics.

I enjoy casually playing through solo Bach, makin' weird music, messing around with synthesizers, noodling on guitar, and being outside with my dogs.
