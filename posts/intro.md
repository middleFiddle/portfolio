I'm a web developer focused on enabling contractors, artists, artisans, small businesses and freelancers by reducing the burden of adminstration tasks while delivering maximally accessible and responsive websites.

My bread and butter is working with React and Typescript. I work primarily with Next.js because it's expressiveness and flexibility allow me to deliver as much static content from the server as possible while using all of the powers of React. I enjoy working with Typescript and Prisma for full-stack type safety.  For styling, I'm partial to TailwindCSS.
