title: Intro

I'm a web developer focused enabling contractors, artists, artisans, small businesses and freelancers to organize their operations and simplify their communication with clients.

I work primarily with Next.js because it's expressiveness and flexibility allow me to deliver rich, optimized, accessible content easily. I enjoy working with Typescript and Prisma for full-stack type safety. I love using TailwindCSS.

I am looking for opportunities to deepen my knowledge of Web Components and WASM/WASI. In addition to my current stack, I would also welcome opportunitites to work with Qwik, Polymer, SolidJS or Elixir/Phoenix (I ‚ù§ THE BEAM).
